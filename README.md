The operator creates, updates, deletes uptimerobot monitors for a particular ingress resource. It's designed to use `friendly_name` attribute of a monitor and/or alert contact for unique identification.

## Description

The operator uses [uptimerobot-tooling](https://github.com/bennsimon/uptimerobot-tooling) to handle api requests.

> The operator will delete the monitor it creates when the ingress resource is deleted.

## Configuration

Environment Variables Supported:

In addition to the environments supplied on the tooling mentioned above, the operator has the following configurations.

| Variable        | Description                                             | Default               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `DOMAIN_PREFIX` | The domain name to use when specifying the annotations. | `bennsimon.github.io` |

With the `DOMAIN_PREFIX` as `bennsimon.github.io` the configurations will be supplied as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: https-minimal-ingress
  annotations:
      bennsimon.github.io/uptimerobot-monitor: "true"
      bennsimon.github.io/uptimerobot-monitor-type: "HTTP"
      bennsimon.github.io/uptimerobot-monitor-friendly_name: "tester"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: test-domain.localhost
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

The operator reads configurations of the monitor from the annotation on the ingress resource.

The first annotation entry `bennsimon.github.io/uptimerobot-monitor` enables the ingress resource to be evaluated by the operator. The other annotations supply the attributes of the monitor. The naming convention is:
`bennsimon.github.io/uptimerobot-monitor-<attrib>`.

To get more attributes refer to the tooling documentation and uptime robot api documentation.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for
testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever
cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

> Ensure you have supplied the environment variables here config/manager/manager.yaml.

### Deploying on the cluster

To deploy the operator you will need the following manifests:

*   serviceaccount
*   clusterrole
*   clusterrolebinding
*   deployment

Create a yaml file and paste the yaml snippet below and update configurations to your preferences.

```yaml (uptimerobot-operator.yaml)

1.  Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=bennsimon/uptimerobot-operator:v0.1.0
```

2.  Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=bennsimon/uptimerobot-operator:v0.1.0
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the
Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the
cluster

### Test It Out

1.  Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2.  Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
